## Mac OS X questions

TODO: Many of these questions need to be moved to the
[[https://github.com/orbital-transfer|orbital-transfer]] project.

1. Which package format is preferred for distributing a GUI
   application for non-developers? What's the technical difference
   between .dmg, .pkg, and .app?

   - .dmg is a disk image,
   - .pkg is an installer+archive, and
   - .app is a directory w/ a particular structure that macOS expects applications to have/use

   - .app is the application itself
   - use .dmg if you want to distribute an app and don't need installation scripts
   - use .pkg if you need installation scripts
   - common pattern: put .app inside .dmg along with a shortcut that can be
     dragged to Applications
   - PostgreSQL distributes as a .dmg for standalone installation and a .zip
     for inclusion in other projects <https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/>.
   - Use `hdiutil` to create .dmg <https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/48414/how-do-i-create-a-dmg-file-from-a-directory>.
   - Or this tool that creates icons <https://github.com/andreyvit/create-dmg>.

2. Has anyone here turned homebrew formulae into a package? I'm
   using timsutton/brew-pkg for .pkg right now and it doesn't appear to
   work properly in this VM that I have (not all files are in the
   archive) and doesn't distinguish between build-time and run-time
   deps.

3. Do any of those formats work under their own prefix so that they
   don't get affected by the rest of the system libraries? Or should I
   relocate the homebrew prefix before installing and install there?

4. What about if the application is a script with many libraries?
   This seems like it would help <http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus>.

   This script uses Platypus for Perl <https://github.com/miyagawa/perl-app-builder/blob/master/perl-app-builder.pl>.

5. Does it matter which version of macOS I build the package on?
   Will that effect my ability to distribute it to older versions of
   macOS? Which macOS version does it make sense to target? N releases
   behind the latest version?

6. Is there any remote desktop protocol for a headless VM? I'm using
   a OS X Vagrant box <https://atlas.hashicorp.com/AndrewDryga/boxes/vagrant-box-osx>. All
   my GUI tests work fine, but I can't see the GUI. I need to be able
   to start it from the terminal --- VNC would be great.

   ```
   osx-guest $ sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -off -restart -agent -privs -all -allowAccessFor -allUsers -clientopts -setvncpw -vncpw secret -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes
   
   then do
   host $ vagrant ssh -- -L5908:localhost:5900
   
   host $ xvnc4viewer :8
   [password: secret]
   ```
